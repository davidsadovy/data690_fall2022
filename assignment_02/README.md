## Assignment 02
## Requirements
- Prompt a user to enter 10 integers.
- If the user enters anything other than integers, remind her that only integers are allowed and let her retry.
    - Note: **You need to detect if the user makes a mistake and let the user retry without exiting the program. The previously entered valid inputs should be kept and not lost.**
- Don't allow the user to enter more than 10 or less than 10 integers.
- Display the 10 integers back to the user at the end.
- Calculate the following statistics from the 10 integers entered and display the results back to the user:
    1. Minimum
    2. Maximum
    3. Range
    4. Mean
    5. Variance
    6. Standard Deviation

**Note:**

1. Use the basic Python concepts and methods. 
- Python's min(), max(), list's sort() function are not allowed. You need to write code to find the minimum and maximum.
- Special Python libraries such as statistics, scipy, or numpy are not allowed. 
- You may need to use: 
    - loop (finite and/or infinite loop)
    - if/else
    - break/continue
    - try/except
    - input() function 
    - int() function

2. Implement the solution in the following two different formats:
    - A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
    - A Python script (.py) (**This is optional, not required**)

3. Your source code and outputs should be well formatted and easy to read.

4. Provide good code documentation:
    - Use both Markdown and code comments in the Jupyter Notebook.
    - Use only comments in the Python script. (Python script is optional.)

5. Your user prompts, user inputs and output displays should be nicely formatted with sufficient spaces and line breaks when users run your program.

6. Create a subfolder named "assignment_02" in your personal GitHub repository and upload the notebook file to the subfolder.

7. from your folder in the class organization, refresh your repository with contents from your personal account. (applicable if you work in your personal GitHub repository)

8. Submit the link to your assignment_02 folder in BB. No files should be uploaded to the BB.
